# CS 6475 Computational Photography

This repository contains all assignments and projects for Georgia Tech's CS 6475 Computational Photography course. Due dates & course policies can be found on the Course Website.

## Assignments 

- **Assignment 0: Introduction**

In this assignment, you will become familiar with the course submission process. You will be required to write some Python code, create a report using a LaTeX template, and submit both your report and resources to Gradescope. It is very important to get Assignment 0 completed immediately before starting on Assignment 1.

- **Assignment 1: Camera Obscura**

In this assignment, you will learn about the operation of a camera by performing an experiment where you are _inside_ the camera yourself. Modern cameras -- including high-end DSLRs -- are simply more advanced versions of a camera obscura (also known as a pinhole camera). In this assignment, you will construct your own camera obscura and document the construction and operation of the camera. 

- **Assignment 2: Pyramid Blending**

In this assignment, you will be putting together a pyramid blending pipeline that will allow you to combine separate images into a seamlessly blended image. The technique is based on the Burt & Adelson paper *A Multiresolution Spline With Application to Image Mosaics*. You are required to use your own unique images and design a custom mask that best supports your image blend.

- **Assignment 3: Panoramas**

In this assignment, you will be writing code to align & stitch together a series of images into a panorama. You will then use your code on your own pictures to make a panorama.


- **Assignment 4: High Dynamic Range**

In this assignment, we will focus on the core algorithms behind computing HDR images based on the Debevec & Malik paper *Recovering High Dynamic Range Radiance Maps from Photographs*. 


- **Assignment 5: Video Textures**

In this assignment we will be applying our Computational Photography magic to video, with the purpose of creating video textures, or infinitely looping pieces of video. These are basically gifs with very smooth transitions, as seen in Lesson 06-02, Video Textures. The process is also described in the Sch√∂dl, et al. paper *Video Textures*.


## Projects 

The goal of the projects is to independently replicate the results of previously published Computational Photography papers.


## Final Portfolio

The final portfolio showcases your work over the course of the semester to demonstrate what you learned and the results you achieved.
