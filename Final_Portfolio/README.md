# Coursework Portfolio

**Important Notes:** There will be no 2 late day option and there will be no regrade requests for the Final Portfolio, unless you see some drastic mistake we made in your grade. 

## Synopsis

The goal of this assignment is to showcase all the work you have done in this class in one final course portfolio.  You will create a slide presentation of your class assignments and projects.  You may share the portfolio with your friends and family so that they can see what kept you busy this term.


## Instructions

### 1. Complete the portfolio by compiling your results from the term in the template file

Download a copy of the Final Portfolio template provided in this directory and update it with your information from all 5 assignments and 2 projects.  If you were unable to complete any of the assignments/projects this semester, still fill out a slide that at least states the purpose of the assignment/project and mention what you were unable to complete. Do NOT skip over the assignment/project. Your portfolio should have at least 1 slide for each assignment and project.

You are not limited to one slide per assignment/project. Feel free to add more slides and show new results if you want to. Be creative and reasonably detailed - make sure the purpose of each assignment and project is clear. If you were to show your portfolio to anyone outside this class, would they understand what you were trying to accomplish? Portfolios that include 1) your inputs and results from every assignment/project 2) are neat and well organized  3) clearly identify each assignment/projectâ€™s purpose and 4) mention your experience or reactions, generally receive full scores. If you follow these instructions and give full effort, you should be fine.

**Note:** Make sure that ALL links you include in your portfolio are viewable by anyone with the link.  We cannot grade what we do not see.  Test your links from another computer, or have someone else test them from your portfolio before you submit.

### 2. Submit the Portfolio

Save your portfolio as `portfolio.pdf` and submit it on Gradescope under **Final Portfolio**. Select "SUBMIT PDF" and upload your `portfolio.pdf`. In the Question Outline on the left, select the one question listed called "Final Portfolio", and then select **ALL** the pages of your portfolio in sequential order. There is no need to submit your portfolio on Canvas.

**Note:** The total size of your portfolio must be less than 8MB for this assignment. If your submission is too large, you can reduce the scale of your images or portfolio. You can compress your portfolio using [Smallpdf](https://smallpdf.com/compress-pdf).
